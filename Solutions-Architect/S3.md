# S3 Buckets

- Private by default.

## Object

- File from 0 bytes up to 5TB.
- Has metadata.


## Bucket

- Region scale.
- 100 soft limit, 1000 hard limit per account.
- Unlimited objects.
- Key = Name, Value = Data


### Name

- Bucket names are **globally unique**!
- 3 - 63 characters, all lower case, no underscores.
- Starts with a lowercase letter or a number.
- Can't be IP formatted e.g. 1.1.1.1


## Patterns and Anti-Patterns

- S3 is an object store (not file or block).
- Cannot be mounted.
- Great for large scale data storage, distribution, or upload.
- Great for 'offload'.
- Input and Output to many AWS products.


## Exam

- Policy
    - Identity
        - Control different resources
        - IAM
        - Same account
    - Bucket
        - Just controlling S3
        - Anonymous or Cross-Account
    - ACLs: NEVER USE THIS


## Access Control Lists (ACLs)
